Welcome to Stereum's Github Page 👋
The Stereum team develops tools to manage the process of setting up & maintaining an Ethereum node simpler without compromising self sovereignty, privacy and flexibility.

An Ethereum node enable its user to use dApps in the most decentralized fashion, to participate in the network by staking $ETH & to obtain/collect their own blockchain data. Stereum aims to cover your use-case as well!
